I"ª<p>The blog is meant to pull together various bits of information that I have realised while studying Physics. Not every post is an earth shattering revelation - more a small realisation! I thought it worth collecting these thoughts as working my way through these various problems took a while so hopefully this will speed up someone elseâ€™s realisations!</p>

<p>Here is a list of all of the posts organised by whether the post focusses in on an argument, technique, formalism or example. The categories here are a lot more broad than the tags which provide a lot more granularity in topic - which can be found <a href="/tags/">here</a>.</p>

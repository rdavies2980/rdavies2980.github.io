I"c<p>In the previous blog post, a way to stitch together Green’s functions to get an overall non-homogeneous result was explored. The thing that broke translational invariance in that case was a change in the parameters of the system between two different constant values. This is obviously not the only way in which we can break this symmetry.</p>

<p>The way that will be looked into here is due to terms in the Hamiltonian of our system being local. The overall technique remains the same, solving either side and then gluing the pieces together. This time, however, instead of performing this to the Green’s function we will glue operators. There are many parallels between the two techniques though!</p>

<p>This example is taken from the notes on refermionisation in my Egger-Grabert 1998 paper, although Chamon, Freed, and Wen’s 1996 paper is a lot more clear.</p>

<h2 id="the-hamiltonian">The Hamiltonian</h2>

<p>So we introduce our Hamiltonian with no context</p>

\[\begin{equation}
    H = -i\hbar \nu \int dx \psi^{\dagger}\partial_x \psi + V(c + c^{\dagger})(\psi(0) + \psi^{\dagger}(0))
\end{equation}\]

<p>with the effective impurity strength of \(\lambda_B = \pi a \lambda^2/ \hbar \nu\). The kinetic term has that particular form as that is a sum over the modes with a linear dispersion (see Luttinger Liquid notes for context). Owing to the choosing of \(K=1/2\), the ‘refermions’ are now free rather than interacting and we have a delta function interacting barrier at \(x=0\). Therefore this is now just a scattering problem, which can be solve in a variety of ways. In this paper they choose use the equation of motion method and essentially find the equations of motion for the system, where the majorana mode has been renamed \(f\)</p>

\[\begin{equation}
    -i\partial_t \phi = [H, \phi] = i\partial_x \phi + Vf\delta(x), \quad \quad -i\partial_t \phi^{\dagger} = [H, \phi] = i\partial_x \phi^{\dagger} + Vf\delta(x),
\end{equation}\]

<p>and the time dependence of the Majorana mode must also be found and solved for,</p>

\[\begin{equation}
    -i\partial_t f = [H,f] = V(\psi(0) + \psi^{\dagger}(0))
\end{equation}\]

<h3 id="solving-and-joining-the-individual-pieces">Solving and joining the individual pieces</h3>

<p>Away from \(x=0\) the field can be found and solved for as it must satisfy the equation \((i\partial_t + i\partial_x)\psi = 0\), with the form of \(\psi\) being able to be found by taking the Fourier transform. This must can be different either side of \(x=0\) so in general our solution will be,</p>

\[\begin{equation}
    \psi(x,t) = \frac{1}{L}\sum_k e^{ik(\nu t -x)} \left\{
                \begin{array}{ll}
                  a_k, \quad \quad (x&lt;0)\\
                  b_k, \quad \quad (x&gt;0)\\
                \end{array} = \frac{1}{L}\sum_k e^{ik(\nu t -x)} \ ( \Theta(-x)a_{k} + \Theta(x)b_k)
              \right.
\end{equation}\]

<p>To find the boundary condition to join these two solutions together we must solve for \(f\) which involves defining \(\psi(0)\). To ensure commutation relations are satisfied (as \(\psi\) is bosonic and \(f\) makes the combination \(f\psi\) fermionic) we define \(\psi(0) = (\psi(0^+) + \psi(0^-))/2\). Therefore solving for \(f\) with this definition we can find that,</p>

\[\begin{equation}
    f_{\omega} = \frac{V}{\omega}(\psi_{\omega}(0) + \psi_{\omega}^{\dagger}(0)) =  \frac{V}{2\omega}(a_k + b_k + a^{\dagger}_k + b^{\dagger}_k)
\end{equation}\]

<p>Now we plug back into the equations of motion, splitting it up into \(\psi_L(x,t) = \frac{1}{L} \sum_{k} e^{ik(\nu t- x)} a_k\) and \(\psi_R\) respectively, joined together by a theta function. This gives,</p>

\[\begin{align}
    (i\partial_t + i\partial_x)(\psi_L\Theta(-x) + \psi_R\Theta(x)) &amp;= 2Vf\delta(x)\\
    \Theta(-x)(i\partial_t + i\partial_x)\psi_L + \Theta(x)(i\partial_t + i\partial_x)\psi_R + i\psi_L\partial_x\Theta(-x) + i\psi_R\partial_x\Theta(x) &amp;=  2Vf\delta(x) \\
    i(\psi_R - \psi_L)\delta(x) = 2Vf(x)\delta(x)
\end{align}\]

<p>therefore we can equate the two coefficients of the delta function and take the Fourier transform to obtain,</p>

\[\begin{equation}
    i(b_k - a_k) = -\frac{\hbar \nu \lambda_B}{2\omega}(a_k + b_k + a^{\dagger}_k + b^{\dagger}_k)
\end{equation}\]

<p>and the procedure can be repeated on the equation of motion for the conjugate \(\psi^{\dagger}\). This gives two equations from which we can eliminate \(b^{\dagger}_k\) to obtain a relations between the scattering components,</p>

\[\begin{equation}
    2b_k = ( 1 + \frac{i\hbar \nu k- \lambda_B}{i\hbar \nu k + \lambda_B})a_k + ( 1 - \frac{i\hbar \nu k- \lambda_B}{i\hbar \nu k + \lambda_B})a^{\dagger}_k
\end{equation}\]

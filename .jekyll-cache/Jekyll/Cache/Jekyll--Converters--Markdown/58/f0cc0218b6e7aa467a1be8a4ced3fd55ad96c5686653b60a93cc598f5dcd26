I"Ü<p>This blog is meant to pull together various bits of information that I have realised while studying Physics. Not every post is an earth shattering revelation - more a small realisation! I thought it worth collecting these thoughts as working my way through these various problems took a while so hopefully this will speed up someone elseâ€™s realisations!</p>

<p>Here is a list of all of the posts to the blog organised by the various topics that they contain</p>

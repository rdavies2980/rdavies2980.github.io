I'm a postdoc who specialises in quantum transport in lower dimensional systems - think of Luttinger Liquids and Quantum Point Contacts! Due to the nature of my research, there has been *a lot* of literature review and I learn things by writing out notes so I thought it would be useful to people in a similar area to have extra resources.

The general topic notes are inspired from talks I have given to PhD students as part of a seminar series I set up that tries to give enough of an introduction so that people get a flavour of the topic. Notes on papers tend to be trying to fill in the gaps in papers that go unspoken, hidden within citations within further citations. The blog is intended for smaller points that don't fit into the other two categories.

Apart from physics, I make music (although I'm not shameless enough to plug it here!). In my spare time I'll be either cooking elaborate meals or trying to find a new indie game to get obsessed with.

            <div class="archive__item-excerpt">
              <p> This alternative formulation of quantum physics is a powerful way to formulate problems. Attributed to Feynman, it provides some understanding of how quantum behaviour occurs in language removed from linear algebra.</p>
              <p> This is meant to be a more complete set of notes on all of path integrals but is more of an introduction at the moment. The intro is intended to be readable to all. The path integrals is accessible to latter year undergraduates but the field integrals are harder and at a postgrad level.  </p>

              <p>These notes are on the Peierls Instability, a phenomenon that ensures that simple pictures of metals do not work in 1D. The process outlined of diverging susceptibility resulting in a new phase is quite general and the analysis here mirrors that done in superconductors but in a more physically intuitive way. </p>
              <p>Contains use of second quantised operators throughout, with linear response ideas stated. This provides a concrete example of how we investigate a condensed matter model by employing various descriptions of the physics. </p>

              <p>The Renormalisation Group is often said to be one of the crowning achievements of physics, tying up issues of divergences in many theories and giving an appealing basis for them. It is a theory about theories and deserves its placement in the pantheon of theoretical physics.</p>
              <p>Contains a wide variety of techniques, with the first half of the notes requiring knowledge of partition functions and quantum mechanics to an undergraduate level. The latter half uses functional integration but is not crucial to understanding the basic principle.</p>

                <p> Solitons present a unique non-linear solution to certain differential equations and crucially allow us to access solutions that cannot be obtained perturbatively.</p>
                <p> The first part of these notes is understandable to latter year undergraduates but the full quantisation of the soliton in the second half requires higher level QFT techniques.</p>

                <p> Luttinger liquids are a universal model of 1D physics, describing the low energy properties of these systems. To obtain the model, the process of bosonisation is needed, which is shown here in three different ways. The new behaviour that is unique to 1D systems is also explored.</p>
                <p> These notes require familiarity with QFT and uses both functional and operator methods. The process of defining the model from an underlying system is shown, but the properties are not deried from this model in these notes. </p>

              <div class="archive__item-excerpt">
                <p> These notes lay the foundations of non-equilibrium quantum theory by examining how time-dependent operators are averaged in zero and finite temperature field theories. The mathematical idea of contours in complex time in the `simple' cases is gone through in depth.  </p>
                <p> These notes go into a bit more depth than a usual introduction to QFT, but does start at the beginning - so only basic linear algebra knowledge is needed. It is not intended as an introduction to the concepts but as mostly talks about ideas rather than doing examples. </p>
